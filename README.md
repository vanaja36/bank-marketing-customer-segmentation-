Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis & Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a bank’s marketing campaign dataset to identify patterns in customer behavior and segment customers into meaningful groups using KMeans clustering. The insights from this project can help banks design more effective marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and increase campaign success rates.

🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics and campaign responses.

Preprocess and transform the data for clustering.

Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.

Visualize customer segments for business insights.

Provide recommendations to improve marketing campaign performance.

📂 Dataset

Source: Bank marketing campaign dataset (UCI repository / Kaggle).

Size: Contains customer demographic and campaign-related attributes such as:

Age

Job

Marital Status

Education

Campaign response (yes/no)

Previous outcomes, etc.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – KMeans clustering, preprocessing

🔑 Key Steps

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Customer demographics distribution

Campaign success/failure trends

Correlation between features

Clustering with KMeans

Finding optimal number of clusters (Elbow method & Silhouette Score)

Training KMeans model

Assigning customers to segments

Visualization & Insights

Cluster visualization using PCA / t-SNE

Segment profiling (age group, job type, education, etc.)

Business recommendations

📊 Results & Insights

Customers were grouped into X distinct segments (replace X with your result).

Identified key customer groups most likely to respond positively to campaigns.

Provided recommendations for personalized marketing strategies.
